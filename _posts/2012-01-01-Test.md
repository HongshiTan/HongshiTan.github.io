Display math:
```math
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
```
and inline math $`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`$.


<p>For sequences of numbers, <em>limit inferior</em> and <em>limit
superior</em> are defined as $\liminf (a_n):=\sup\{\inf\{a_k:k \ge
n\}\}$ and $\limsup (a_n):=\inf\{\sup\{a_k:k \ge n\}\}$ respectively;
for sequences of sets, they are defined as $\displaystyle
\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=n}^{\infty} A_k$ and $\displaystyle
\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty} A_k$ respectively.</p>
