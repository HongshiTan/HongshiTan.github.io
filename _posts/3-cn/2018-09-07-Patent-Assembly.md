<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

The invention provides a radar assembly and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Provided is a radar assembly (20), comprising an electric motor (21), a microwave radar (22) and a holder (23). The electric motor (21) comprises a rotor (214). The microwave radar (22) comprises a transmitter (222) and a receiver (224). The transmitter (222) is used for directionally transmitting a microwave signal, and the receiver (224) is used for receiving the microwave signal reflected back. The holder (23) is used for mounting the microwave radar (22). The rotor (214) is connected to the holder (23) and can drive the holder (23) to rotate and thus drive the microwave radar (22) to rotate, so that the microwave radar (22) can selectively transmit microwave signals in multiple directions and receive the microwavesignals reflected back from the multiple directions. Further provided is an unmanned aerial vehicle (100). The unmanned aerial vehicle (100) comprises a vehicle body (10) and the radar assembly (20) mounted on the vehicle body (10).
