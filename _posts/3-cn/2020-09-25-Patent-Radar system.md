<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

A radar system, a signal acquisition method, a movable platform and a storage medium are disclosed. The radar detection equipment is driven to rotate by a rotating device, so that the radar detectionequipment can be rotated. The radar detection equipment includes a processor, multiple analog/digital converters and multiple antennas. The processor is electrically connected with each analog/digitalconverter among the multiple analog/digital converters. Each analog/digital converter is electrically connected with at least one antenna, so that each analog/digital converter can convert a reflected signal received by at least one antenna connected to the analog/digital converter into a digital signal. The processor synchronously acquires the digital signals converted by the multiple analog/digital converters at the same time, so that the radar detection equipment can acquire data from multiple channels at the same time, which improves the efficiency, synchronization and real-time performance of data acquisition.
