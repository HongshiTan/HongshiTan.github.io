<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

The embodiment of the utility model provides a radar system and a movable platform. According to the embodiment of the utility model, the motor in the rotating device drives the radar detection equipment to rotate; the radar detection equipment can rotate; the radar detection equipment comprises a processor, a plurality of analog/digital converters and a plurality of antennas, the processor is electrically connected with each analog-to-digital converter in a plurality of analog-to-digital converters. Each analog/digital converter is electrically connected with at least one antenna; each analog/digital converter can convert a reflection signal received by at least one antenna connected with the analog/digital converter into a digital signal; that is to say, it is possible to obtain a product, each analog/digital converter can convert the reflected signal in at least one channel into a digital signal; the processor synchronously collects the digital signals converted by the analog/digital converters at the same time, so that the radar detection equipment can obtain the data of multiple channels at the same time, and the data collection efficiency, synchronism and real-time performance are improved.
