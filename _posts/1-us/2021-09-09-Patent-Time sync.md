<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

The present disclosure provides a time synchronization method, device and system, and a storage medium. The time synchronization system includes a first part and a second part, that are mechanically connected, movable relative to each other, and in a wireless communication connection. The method includes the second part receiving the first time axis information and the first movement parameter sent by the first part, the first movement parameter corresponding to the first time axis information for indicating a movement relationship between the first part and the second part; the second part determining the second time axis information corresponding to the first movement parameter in the local second time axis; and the second part adjusting the second time axis based on the first time axis information and the second time axis information, such that the second time axis is synchronized with the first time axis.
