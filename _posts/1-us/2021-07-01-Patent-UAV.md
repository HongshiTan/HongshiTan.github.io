<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

A terrain prediction method includes obtaining N pieces of ranging data obtained by a continuous wave radar performing ranging on ground during rotation and when a rotation angle of the continuous wave radar is in a predetermined angle range, excluding outliers from the N pieces of ranging data to obtain M pieces of ranging data, and determining a terrain parameter of the ground according to the M pieces of ranging data. N is an integer greater than 1. M is a positive integer smaller than N. The terrain parameter includes at least one of a slope, a flatness, or a height value of the continuous wave radar to the ground directly below.
