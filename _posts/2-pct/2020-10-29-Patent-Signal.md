<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

A radar system, a signal collection method, a mobile platform, and a storage medium. By means of a rotation apparatus, a radar detection device is driven to rotate, causing said radar detection device to be able to rotate. Said radar detection device comprises a processor, a plurality of analog/digital converters and a plurality of antennas. By means of the processor being electrically connected to each analog/digital converter among the plurality of analog/digital converters, and each analog/digital converter being electrically connected to at least one antenna, each analog/digital converter is caused to be able to convert a reflected signal received by the at least one antenna connected to same into a digital signal, and in a same instant, the digital signals that have been converted by the plurality of analog/digital converters are synchronously collected by means of the processor. The radar detection device is thus made capable of acquiring data from a plurality of channels in a same instant, improving the efficiency and synchrony of data collection, and the degree to which said collection is in real time.
