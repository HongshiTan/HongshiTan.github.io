<h2 class="tags-item-label">Description</h2>

The invention provides a rotary radar (100) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (1), the rotary radar (100) comprises a rotary base (60), a radar control board (50), an antenna support (40) and an antenna (30), a gap is arranged between the radar control board (50) and the antenna support (40), the antenna (30) is arranged on the antenna support (40), the rotary base is used for supporting and driving the radar control board (50), the antenna support (40) and the antenna (30) to rotate. At least one flow guide member (70) is located on at least one side of the radar control panel (50) and/or the antenna (30), and the flow guide member (70) is used for guiding airflow into the gap when the rotary radar (100) rotates. The rotation characteristic of the rotary radar (100) drives the flow guide part (70) to rotate, air flow is introduced into a gap between the radar control panel (50) and the antenna support (40), heat on the surface of the radar control panel (50) is taken away, the purpose of heat dissipation is achieved, and continuous and stable work of the rotary radar (100) for the unmanned aerial vehicle (1) is achieved.
